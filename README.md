Hi there, I'm Haruto Ito 👋

I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Tokyo (Dept. of Civil Engineering), affiliated with the Lab for Innovative Infrastructure Systems (LIIS).

My primary research interest lies in Structural Estimation and Econometrics (Discrete Choice Models), with a focus on high-performance computing using JAX.

Currently, I also work as a Product Management Intern at HENNGE K.K., bridging the gap between technical implementation and product strategy.

🌱 Working on:

* Developing [Econox](https://github.com/ito-haru/econox), a JAX-based structural estimation library.

* Graduate thesis on behavioral modeling.

📫 Tech Stack: Python (JAX, NumPy), Google Apps Script
