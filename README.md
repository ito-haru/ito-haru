## Hi there 👋

I'm a student of the University of Tokyo.
I belong to the department of civil engineering.
I'm interested in mathematical analysis and simulation of how people or cars act in a city.

Also, I'm a member of NPO Mochikoma, powering the co-learnig space for UTokyo Students named KOMAD, which locates near Komaba Canpus, University of Tokyo.
